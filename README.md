Projects from Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

First Project: Easy21 Game
Easy21 is a game similar to Blackjack but with some alterations to the rules to make it a bit simpler (No Aces, and card values are a uniform disribution 1-10) and also a bit more complex (There are now Positive and Negative-valued cards, and 2 ways to bust).

A Monte-Carlo method will be used to create a policy for the game.
